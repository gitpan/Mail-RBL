Mail::RBL - Perform queries to blacklists
- - -----------------------------------------

This module is meant to help querying blackhole lists, typically for
use in anti-spam solutions.

This code could be used as follows:

  use Mail::RBL;

  my $rbl = new Mail::RBL 'list.dsbl.org';
  print "yeah!\n" unless $rbl->check('10.10.10.10');

This module is entirely written in  Perl, so you do not need access to
a compiler to use it.  It  has been extensively tested in a variety of
platforms.  An extensive  test suite  is provided  with the  module to
verify correct results.

The lastest version of this module should be preferred. You can obtain
it  on http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/L/LU/LUISMUNOZ/  or  one of  the
many CPAN  mirrors. Please find a  mirror near you to  help spread the
load.

This module depends on you having the following co-requisite modules
(which you can obtain from CPAN):

- - - Test::More
- - - NetAddr::IP

To install, follow the standard CPAN recipe of:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test

If all tests pass, then do

$ make install

To access the module's documentation, please see

$ perldoc Mail::RBL

Bug  reports  are  welcome. Please  do  not  forget  to tell  me  what
version/platform are you running this code on. Providing a small piece
of  code that  shows the  bug helps  me a  lot in  sorting it  out and
possibly in writting more tests for the distribution.

Also, this code is intended to be strict and -w safe, so please report
cases where warnings are generated so that I can fix them.

Report your bugs to me (luismunoz@cpan.org).

DO YOU WANT TO SAY THANKS?

I've been asked this question enough times so as to setup a page where
you can express your gratitude, at either of those URLs

	http://mipagina.cantv.net/lem/thanks-en.html (English)

This is in no way a  requirement for using my code, getting support or
requesting features.
